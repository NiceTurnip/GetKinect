### Cost Savings from Eliminating Key Fobs and Cards

One of the biggest advantages of using a member app for door access is the freedom it gives me from needing front desk staff. In fact, I’ve taken it even further—I'm the only staff member. Aside from spending about an hour and a half each week cleaning and checking on each gym, there's little else I need to do to keep things running.

### How Members Can Join and Access the Gym in Just 12 Minutes

With the app, people can join online in roughly 12 minutes, including signing waivers and setting up payment. The app grants them access to the gym within that same timeframe, so I wake up some mornings to three to five new members without lifting a finger. If I were paying someone minimum wage for 25 to 30 hours a week just to handle these tasks, it would significantly impact my profits, especially in a smaller gym with around 125-150 members. From that perspective, the Kinect app and software are brilliant.

Another cost-saving benefit of ditching key fobs and cards is avoiding the hassle that comes with them. Key cards are easy to lose or abuse, and while they may only cost around $4-5 each, there’s also shipping, reprogramming time, and the occasional need for replacements. Frankly, I'd rather spend my time on things that matter more.

### Managing Multiple Gyms from a Single Smartphone: Here’s How

The system is also highly scalable. Since everything runs through members' smartphones, there's no limit to how many people can join, and you don’t need additional hardware. With traditional key fobs or cards, you typically need a door reader, which can cost a few hundred to over $1000, not to mention installation time if you’re not doing it yourself. But by using a smartphone-based system that relies on Wi-Fi and geolocation, there’s no door hardware to set up—just a simple electronic door strike if needed, which lets any smartphone act as a gym key.

Right now, I’m managing two gyms with a single smartphone. I can filter between memberships, door access, plans, and even handle promotions across both locations. When I first started, I integrated the two gyms, allowing members to use either one. Since then, I’ve decided to separate them because one gym is larger, has a few new features, and is priced differently, but I still only need one phone to handle both gyms.

Designed to guide small to mid-sized gym owners through the latest in fitness technology, each article builds on the last—like chapters in a book. I draw from my own experience growing my gyms to show how smartphone-based access and management can truly simplify the gym owner’s journey.**
