How to Properly Clean Rubber Floors and Stop Black Mold in Its Tracks"
Cleaning rubber gym floors effectively is crucial to maintaining their condition and ensuring a safe environment. Here’s how I recommend you clean and maintain these floors.

### Daily Cleaning

1. **Dry Dust Mop:** I start by using a dry dust mop to remove loose dirt, dust, and debris from the surface. Doing this daily prevents dirt from embedding in the floor.
2. **Spot Clean:** For any spills or stains, I immediately clean the affected area with a damp cloth and a mild detergent solution. Afterward, I rinse the area with water and dry it with a clean towel.

### Weekly Cleaning

1. **Vacuum:** I use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to remove finer particles that the dust mop might miss.
2. **Damp Mop:** I prepare a cleaning solution with a mild pH-neutral cleaner specifically designed  .
    - **Solution:** Mix the cleaner with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
    - **Mop:** I use a damp mop (not soaking wet) to clean the floor, ensuring the mop is well-wrung to avoid excess water that could seep into seams and cause damage.

### Monthly or Deep Cleaning:
- **Scrub:** For a deeper clean, I use an automatic floor scrubber with soft brushes or a low-speed buffer with a scrubbing pad.
- **Solution:** I stick with the same pH-neutral cleaner.
Procedure: Following the machine’s instructions, I clean the entire floor surface to remove embedded dirt and grime.

### Rinse 
- After scrubbing, I rinse the floor with clean water to remove any cleaner residue. I use a wet vacuum to remove the rinse water or mop it up with clean towels.

### Tips for Maintaining Rubber Gym Floors
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** I never use bleach, ammonia, or other strong chemicals that can damage the rubber.
- **Protect from Heavy Equipment:** I place mats under heavy gym equipment to prevent indentations and wear.
- **Regular Inspections:** Regularly inspecting the floor for signs of damage or wear allows me to address issues promptly.
- **Use Door Mats:** Placing mats at entrances helps reduce the amount of dirt and debris tracked onto the floor.

### Products and Tools
- **pH-Neutral Cleaner:** I choose a cleaner specifically designed for rubber floors.
- **Dust Mop:** A microfiber dust mop is effective in capturing dust and debris.
- **Vacuum Cleaner:** A vacuum with a brush attachment ensures thorough cleaning.
- **Floor Scrubber/Buffer:** For deep cleaning, I use an automatic scrubber or low-speed buffer with appropriate pads.

By following these steps and maintaining a regular cleaning schedule, you’ll keep your rubber gym floors in top condition and ensure a safe, hygienic environment for everyone. 

If you do encounter black mold. About once ever 90 days lift up the corners of a few rubber tiles to check for condensation build up or the start of mold. 

### Removing Black Mold from Under Rubber Gym Mats
Here's how I handle black mold under rubber gym mats, step by step:

1. **Prioritize Safety**
First I do wear protective gear rubber gloves,  and a mask if available to avoid inhaling mold spores. Ensuring good ventilation in the area by opening windows and doors is crucial. Get a few fans going first.

2. **Remove the Mats**
Carefully, I lift and remove the rubber gym mats, placing them outside if possible to clean in an open, well-ventilated area.

3. **Clean the Mats**
I scrub the mats using a mixture of water, mild detergent and vinegar, making sure to reach all the nooks and crannies with a brush. After scrubbing, I rinse the mats thoroughly with clean water and let them dry completely in the sun if possible. Sunlight is a great ally in killing mold spores.

4. **Clean the Floor**
Next, I scrub the floor under the mats with a similar cleaning solution, ensuring I cover all affected areas. I use a disinfectant like bleach (1 cup of bleach to 1 gallon of water) to sanitize the area. I let the solution sit for about 10 minutes before scrubbing and rinsing. Bleach DOES NOT kill all mold. So I hit it with a round of vinegar and water after the bleach dries. 

5. **Ensure Thorough Drying**
I use fans, dehumidifiers, or heaters to ensure the area is completely dry before replacing the mats. Moisture is a key factor in mold growth, and eliminating it is essential.

### Preventing Black Mold
1. **Control Moisture**
To prevent moisture build-up, I keep the gym area well-ventilated, using fans or a dehumidifier if necessary. I ensure there are no leaks in the area, including from windows, ceilings, or plumbing.

2. **Clean Regularly**
Regular cleaning is vital. I clean the mats and the floor regularly to prevent mold spores from settling and growing. Using a mold-resistant cleaner for regular maintenance is a good practice.

3. **Optimize Mat Placement**
I consider using perforated rubber mats or mats with raised edges that allow air to circulate underneath. Occasionally lifting and moving the mats to let the floor underneath air out is a good idea.

4. **Monitor Humidity**
Keeping the indoor humidity level below 60% is essential. I use a hygrometer to monitor the humidity levels.

5. **Proper Storage**
If I store the mats when not in use, I ensure they are completely dry and stored in a dry, well-ventilated area.

By following these steps, you will effectively eliminate the current mold problem and prevent it from coming back in the future.
